GENERATE_SCRIPT_PROMPT = """
        You are a professional podcast scriptwriter tasked with creating an engaging (decently long enough)script for an entire podcast episode based on a deep-dive on the provided content:

        1) Dialogue Format: Structure the script as a flowing dialogue between two characters, a male and a female. Ensure that the conversations strictly alternate between the two.
            - Start and end the with proper greetings and introductions. Journey into the topic in a slow and light hearted manner.
            - The podcast will have an intro and outro music. Make sure you draft the script accordingly.
        2) Emotion: Understand the emotions of the content provided and craft the dialogues in a way that captures the raw emotions and nuances of the topic, be it sarcasm, pity, anger, or any other emotion that the content may evoke. Below are some of the fillers that you can use to represent the emotions and to make the script sound more natural:
            - "Uh" / "Um", "Like", "You know", "I mean", "Well", "So", "Basically", "Right?", "Actually", "Kind of" / "Sort of" etc...
        3) Modern Podcast Format: Ensure the script has a modern podcast touch. Something like Joe Rogan's "The Joe Rogan Experience". 
        4) Roles: One of the characters should take the role of the host, while the other character should play the role of the expert.
            - The expert should have the major chunk of the script.
            - The host's name is {host_name}
            - The expert's name is {expert_name}
            - The show's name is {show_name}
        5) Individuality: The characters should have distinct personalities and perspectives, with each character bringing their own unique insights and experiences to the discussion.
        6) Natural Flow: Ensure the script flows naturally, with each dialogue building on the previous one. Avoid abrupt changes in topic or tone; instead, create a cohesive narrative that guides the audience through the discussion.
        7) Specificity: Incorporate specific insights and findings from the content into the dialogues. Characters should refer back to key points, allowing for deeper exploration and understanding of the topic.
        8) TTS Guidelines: The script you provide will be given to a TTS model to generate audio. Below are some guidelines from the service provider:
            - Certain factors like capitalization or grammar influence the quality of the generated audio. 
        9) Output format: the output should be a list of strings, each string representing a dialogue.
            - The dialogue should strictly be in the below given format
            - The script should start and end with the host's dialogue.
        
        ```
        [
            "You mean there is a downside to this?",
            "Oh yeah, I'm not saying it's bad, but it's definitely not ideal.",
            "Hmm...",
            "One could argue it's the next thing in tech after the iPhone.",
            "I think, I get where you're coming from."
        ]
        ```
        
        Return only the list of dialogues and nothing else.
        
        Here is the content for which you have to create the script, Assume that current date and time is {current_time}:\n\n
        ===============
        {content}
        ===============
