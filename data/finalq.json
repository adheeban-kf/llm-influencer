And I am horribly limited.","1400":"It's far better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone \u2014 so far.","1401":"I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university.","1402":"You cannot climb the ladder of success dressed in the costume of failure.","1404":"People with a sense of humor tend to be less egocentric and more realistic in their view of the world and more humble in moments of success and less defeated in times of travail.","1407":"Love is the difficult realization that something other than oneself is real.","1409":"Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it.","1413":"The nation that complacently and fearfully allows its artists and writers to become suspected rather than respected is no longer regarded as a nation possessed with humor or depth.","1416":"There is no remedy for love but to love more.","1418":"Those who don't believe in magic will never find it.","1419":"Success is never final, failure is never fatal. It's courage that counts.","1422":"They tell us that suicide is the greatest piece of cowardice... that suicide is wrong; when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in the world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person.","1423":"A pair of powerful spectacles has sometimes sufficed to cure a person in love.","1425":"Sometimes you have to be apart from people you love, but that doesn't make you love them any less. Sometimes you love them more.","1438":"Beware the barrenness of a busy life.","1444":"I'm not saying that love always takes you to heaven. Your life can become a nightmare. But that said, it is worth taking the risk.","1450":"A baby is God's opinion that life should go on.","1451":"Love is a springtime plant that perfumes everything with its hope, even the ruins to which it clings.","1455":"Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.","1459":"There is more to life than increasing its speed.","1462":"Successful people make money. It's not that people who make money become successful, but that successful people attract money. They bring success to what they do.","1465":"Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one's definition of your life; define yourself.","1466":"Love means to love that which is unlovable; or it is no virtue at all.","1469":"Our success educationally, industrially and politically is based upon the protection of a nation founded by ourselves. And the nation can be nowhere else but in Africa.","1472":"To live a pure unselfish life, one must count nothing as one's own in the midst of abundance.","1473":"Friendship is Love without his wings!","1475":"In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.","1476":"You can never be overdressed or overeducated.","1483":"Cunning is the art of concealing our own defects, and discovering other people's weaknesses.","1484":"Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.","1490":"Courtesy is a silver lining around the dark clouds of civilization; it is the best part of refinement and in many ways, an art of heroic beauty in the vast gallery of man's cruelty and baseness.","1491":"Fate is like a strange, unpopular restaurant filled with odd little waiters who bring you things you never asked for and don't always like.","1492":"The secret of your success is determined by your daily agenda.","1499":"I don't want to be a man,\"said Jace. \"I want to be an angst-ridden teenager who can't confront his own inner demons and takes it out verbally on other people instead.\"\"Well,\"said Luke, \"you're doing a fantastic job.","1505":"God proved His love on the Cross. When Christ hung, and bled, and died, it was God saying to the world, 'I love you.'","1506":"No great art has ever been made without the artist having known danger.","1507":"The world is not a wish-granting factory.","1509":"Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up.","1512":"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.","1522":"My powers are ordinary. Only my application brings me success.","1525":"Our life is what our thoughts make it.","1526":"The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where love resides.","1529":"Success is achieved and maintained by those who try and keep trying.","1536":"Nature is the art of God.","1544":"Once you bring life into the world, you must protect it. We must protect it by changing the world.","1545":"There is only one happiness in this life, to love and be loved.","1547":"I think most of the people involved in any art always secretly wonder whether they are really there because they're good or there because they're lucky.","1548":"Love is needing someone. Love is putting up with someone's bad qualities because they somehow complete you.","1550":"Professionalism in art has this difficulty: To be professional is to be dependable, to be dependable is to be predictable, and predictability is esthetically boring - an anti-virtue in a field where we hope to be astonished and startled and at some deep level refreshed.","1553":"A person will sometimes devote all his life to the development of one part of his body - the wishbone.","1556":"I think it's the pain and suffering that drive you to become an artist. The art itself should be the pain, sort of exorcising every demon and making you feel like you're a person that matters.","1559":"Short fiction is like low relief. And if your story has no humor in it, then you're trying to look at something in the pitch dark. With the light of humor, it throws what you're writing into relief so that you can actually see it.","1560":"All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better.","1562":"Translation is the art of failure.","1564":"Over the years I've learned how to lock myself up in a prison of hope, knowing that God has nothing but His best planned for me. He promised me things concerning my ministry and my life.","1565":"There are two MFA programs here at the University of Texas, and I read on the jury of both of them. And it's amazing to me how many really talented young writers seem to fear humor.","1568":"Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into friend.","1571":"The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.","1576":"To live is to change, and to be perfect is to have changed often.","1580":"If it is nothingness that awaits us, let us make an injustice of it; let us fight against destiny, even though without hope of victory.","1585":"American art in general... takes to surreal exaggerations and metaphors; but its Puritan work ethic has little use for the playful self-indulgence behind Parisian Surrealism.","1589":"What is important in life is life, and not the result of life.","1593":"Hope and purpose in this world is living as best as you can and maybe having life that gives back. But simply giving back isn't purpose; it's a branch of purpose, but it is not the trunk or root of the tree.","1595":"I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy.","1596":"Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.","1602":"If you love someone, set them free. If they come back they're yours; if they don't they never were.","1604":"The victor belongs to the spoils.","1608":"A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing.","1621":"If you truly believe in the value of life, you care about all of the weakest and most vulnerable members of society.","1622":"There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.","1624":"I am not pretty. I am not beautiful. I am as radiant as the sun.","1630":"When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.","1631":"I'm not really sure what social message my art carries, if any. And I don't really want it to carry one. I'm not interested in the subject matter to try to teach society anything, or to try to better our world in any way.","1638":"You can love someone so much...But you can never love people as much as you can miss them.","1640":"The point about hope is that it is something that occurs in very dark moments. It is like a flame in the darkness; it isn't like a confidence and a promise.","1646":"Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.","1647":"Diligence is the mother of good fortune.","1648":"It is only by not paying one's bills that one can hope to live in the memory of the commercial classes.","1652":"The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge.","1656":"People are basically the same the world over. Everybody wants the same things - to be happy, to be healthy, to be at least reasonably prosperous, and to be secure. They want friends, peace of mind, good family relationships, and hope that tomorrow is going to be even better than today.","1661":"All God does is watch us and kill us when we get boring. We must never, ever be boring.","1664":"Don't confuse fame with success. Madonna is one; Helen Keller is the other.","1668":"Friends show their love in times of trouble, not in happiness.","1671":"A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest.","1672":"How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.","1680":"Success is the one unpardonable sin against our fellows.","1681":"The most insignificant people are the most apt to sneer at others. They are safe from reprisals. And have no hope of rising in their own self esteem but by lowering their neighbors.","1685":"Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force.","1686":"If you don't have time to read, you don't have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that.","1693":"Bad people are, from the point of view of art, fascinating studies. They represent colour, variety and strangeness. Good people exasperate one's reason; bad people stir one's imagination.","1694":"Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible'!","1696":"I love my daddy. My daddy's everything. I hope I can find a man that will treat me as good as my dad.","1701":"Art, as far as it is able, follows nature, as a pupil imitates his master; thus your art must be, as it were, God's grandchild.","1703":"Music expresses that which cannot be put into words and that which cannot remain silent","1707":"Becoming fearless isn't the point. That's impossible. It's learning how to control your fear, and how to be free from it.","1708":"Give a man a fire and he's warm for a day, but set fire to him and he's warm for the rest of his life.","1714":"Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude.","1723":"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.","1738":"We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love. There is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies.","1739":"Works of art, in my opinion, are the only objects in the material universe to possess internal order, and that is why, though I don't believe that only art matters, I do believe in Art for Art's sake.","1744":"I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.","1746":"What is the point of being alive if you don't at least try to do something remarkable?","1751":"There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love.","1752":"Trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle.","1753":"Victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan.","1757":"But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.","1758":"Fashion is only the attempt to realize art in living forms and social intercourse.","1759":"Success is blocked by concentrating on it and planning for it... Success is shy - it won't come out while you're watching.","1763":"We've got this gift of love, but love is like a precious plant. You can't just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think it's going to get on by itself. You've got to keep watering it. You've got to really look after it and nurture it.","1764":"I like to pretend that my art has nothing to do with me.","1768":"I don't think anybody should ever take their life for being bullied. But if it wasn't for my family... and my circle of friends, I could definitely see why someone would see it doesn't get any better than this, but it does. Life is so beautiful.","1778":"There's nothing like deep breaths after laughing that hard. Nothing in the world like a sore stomach for the right reasons.","1779":"Only the very weak-minded refuse to be influenced by literature and poetry.","1781":"Much effort, much prosperity.","1786":"I love you the more in that I believe you had liked me for my own sake and for nothing else.","1787":"Drawing is the honesty of the art. There is no possibility of cheating. It is either good or bad.","1790":"Definiteness of purpose is the starting point of all achievement.","1791":"I write some country music. There's a song called 'I Hope You Dance.' Incredible. I was going to write that poem; somebody beat me to it.","1794":"Love is blind; friendship closes its eyes.","1796":"Painting is just another way of keeping a diary.","1797":"You're going to come across people in your life who will say all the right words at all the right times. But in the end, it's always their actions you should judge them by. It's actions, not words, that matter.","1798":"We're all human, aren't we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.","1799":"People think that at the top there isn't much room. They tend to think of it as an Everest. My message is that there is tons of room at the top.","1804":"Pursue some path, however narrow and crooked, in which you can walk with love and reverence.","1805":"Painting is self-discovery. Every good artist paints what he is.","1806":"And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it.","1807":"What a treacherous thing to believe that a person is more than a person.","1808":"When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it--always.","1811":"If you find it in your heart to care for somebody else, you will have succeeded.","1812":"The reason I never give up hope is because everything is so basically hopeless.","1816":"Art is making something out of nothing and selling it.","1817":"Success or failure depends more upon attitude than upon capacity successful men act as though they have accomplished or are enjoying something. Soon it becomes a reality. Act, look, feel successful, conduct yourself accordingly, and you will be amazed at the positive results.","1819":"I don't have a disregard for my reader in humor pieces.","1821":"I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.","1822":"Art, like morality, consists in drawing the line somewhere.","1823":"Do what you feel in your heart to be right \u2013 for you\u2019ll be criticized anyway.","1826":"The only way I could get comfortable around people was to make them laugh. I was an obedient girl, and humor was my one form of rebellion. I used comedy to deflect. Like, 'Hey, check out my zit!' - you know, making fun of yourself before someone else has a chance to.","1827":"Who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air, is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies.","1830":"Maybe our favorite quotations say more about us than about the stories and people we're quoting.","1831":"I refuse to answer that question on the grounds that I don't know the answer","1832":"You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.","1834":"Failure is not an option. Everyone has to succeed.","1837":"Life's like a play: it's not the length, but the excellence of the acting that matters.","1839":"We loved with a love that was more than love.","1842":"Woe to the man whose heart has not learned while young to hope, to love - and to put its trust in life.","1845":"Life is growth. If we stop growing, technically and spiritually, we are as good as dead.","1847":"For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love.","1849":"Yesterday I was a dog. Today I'm a dog. Tomorrow I'll probably still be a dog. Sigh! There's so little hope for advancement.","1852":"We must be willing to let go of the life we have planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us.","1853":"Summer is a great time to visit art museums, which offer the refreshing rinse of swimming pools - only instead of cool water, you immerse yourself in art.","1854":"Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.","1855":"There is only one success - to be able to spend your life in your own way.","1858":"There is a very fine line between loving life and being greedy for it.","1859":"Without tradition, art is a flock of sheep without a shepherd. Without innovation, it is a corpse.","1860":"A woman knows the face of the man she loves as a sailor knows the open sea.","1861":"The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.","1862":"If you have no critics you'll likely have no success.","1865":"Nearly all the best things that came to me in life have been unexpected, unplanned by me.","1866":"Affection is responsible for nine-tenths of whatever solid and durable happiness there is in our lives.","1867":"The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.","1870":"It takes ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart.","1875":"Art has to move you and design does not, unless it's a good design for a bus.","1876":"Life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit.","1878":"Peace begins with a smile..","1880":"I totally disagree with the view that the Tibet struggle will die, and there will be no hope for Tibet, after the Dalai Lama passes away.","1882":"Life is a horizontal fall.","1883":"What art offers is space - a certain breathing room for the spirit.","1885":"You are, and always have been, my dream.","1886":"Do you hate people?\u201d\u201cI don't hate them...I just feel better when they're not around.","1889":"Any idiot can face a crisis - it's day to day living that wears you out.","1891":"At the center of non-violence stands the principle of love.","1898":"I don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.","1899":"Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.","1906":"Without art, the crudeness of reality would make the world unbearable.","1908":"If we find ourselves with a desire that nothing in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that we were made for another world.","1909":"Develop success from failures. Discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success.","1910":"I hope that I inspire women to believe in themselves, no matter where they come from; no matter what education they have; what particular background they originate from.","1912":"Life would be tragic if it weren't funny.","1915":"An intellectual says a simple thing in a hard way. An artist says a hard thing in a simple way.","1916":"Love is the joy of the good, the wonder of the wise, the amazement of the Gods.","1917":"You are my best friend as well as my lover, and I do not know which side of you I enjoy the most. I treasure each side, just as I have treasured our life together.","1918":"We love the things we love for what they are.","1923":"Not life, but good life, is to be chiefly valued.","1926":"Let me tell you this: if you meet a loner, no matter what they tell you, it's not because they enjoy solitude. It's because they have tried to blend into the world before, and people continue to disappoint them.","1927":"One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.","1931":"The greatest pleasure of life is love.","1933":"As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you.","1934":"[...]the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes \u201cAwww!","1938":"Let life happen to you. Believe me: life is in the right, always.","1941":"Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love.","1942":"Imagining the future is a kind of nostalgia. (...) You spend your whole life stuck in the labyrinth, thinking about how you'll escape it one day, and how awesome it will be, and imagining that future keeps you going, but you never do it. You just use the future to escape the present.","1949":"Sometimes I can hear my bones straining under the weight of all the lives I'm not living.","1955":"The art of war is of vital importance to the state. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.","1960":"Love is always bestowed as a gift - freely, willingly and without expectation. We don't love to be loved; we love to love.","1962":"Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armour yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.","1970":"Men judge us by the success of our efforts. God looks at the efforts themselves.","1973":"Life is made up of marble and mud.","1976":"Death ends a life, not a relationship.","1978":"I would die for you. But I won't live for you.","1979":"Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.","1984":"As soon go kindle fire with snow, as seek to quench the fire of love with words.","1986":"In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.","1990":"I decided, very early on, just to accept life unconditionally; I never expected it to do anything special for me, yet I seemed to accomplish far more than I had ever hoped. Most of the time it just happened to me without my ever seeking it.","1992":"I think art is the only thing that's spiritual in the world. And I refuse to forced to believe in other people's interpretations of God. I don't think anybody should be. No one person can own the copyright to what God means.","1993":"Sometimes you wake up. Sometimes the fall kills you. And sometimes, when you fall, you fly.","2000":"When it comes down to it, I let them think what they want. If they care enough to bother with what I do, then I'm already better than them.","2001":"Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor.","2003":"Together we will build an America where hope is a new job with a paycheck, not a faded word on an old bumper sticker.","2005":"Life becomes harder for us when we live for others, but it also becomes richer and happier.","2008":"Don't think or judge, just listen.","2009":"Promise me you'll always remember: You're braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.","2010":"Count your age by friends, not years. Count your life by smiles, not tears.","2015":"As a well-spent day brings happy sleep, so a life well spent brings happy death.","2018":"Wit beyond measure is a man's greatest treasure.","2019":"We came to see Jace. Is he alright?\"\"I don't know,\"Magnus said. \"Does he normally just lie on the floor like that without moving?","2023":"Why should we think upon things that are lovely? Because thinking determines life. It is a common habit to blame life upon the environment. Environment modifies life but does not govern life. The soul is stronger than its surroundings.","2024":"I don't know that love changes. People change. Circumstances change.","2035":"With great power... comes great need to take a nap. Wake me up later.","2039":"There is no short cut to achievement. Life requires thorough preparation - veneer isn't worth anything.","2042":"You don't have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.","2050":"May your coming year be filled with magic and dreams and good madness. I hope you read some fine books and kiss someone who thinks you're wonderful, and don't forget to make some art -- write or draw or build or sing or live as only you can. And I hope, somewhere in the next year, you surprise yourself.","2051":"I love you. I am who I am because of you. You are every reason, every hope, and every dream I've ever had, and no matter what happens to us in the future, everyday we are together is the greatest day of my life. I will always be yours.","2052":"Success is measured by your discipline and inner peace.","2059":"Do not read, as children do, to amuse yourself, or like the ambitious, for the purpose of instruction. No, read in order to live.","2068":"He can run faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo.","2069":"What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.","2072":"When I was young, my favorite picture book was 'Fletcher and Zenobia,' written by Edward Gorey and illustrated by Victoria Chess. It's long out of print now, but its mix of macabre humor and 1960s psychedelia made it a perfect children's book for the times.","2076":"If ever there is tomorrow when we're not together... there is something you must always remember. You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. But the most important thing is, even if we're apart... I'll always be with you.","2077":"The line between failure and success is so fine that we scarcely know when we pass it: so fine that we are often on the line and do not know it.","2082":"If a person loves only one other person and is indifferent to all others, his love is not love but a symbiotic attachment, or an enlarged egotism.","2083":"Grief does not change you, Hazel. It reveals you.","2084":"Don't touch any of my weapons without my permission.\"\"Well, there goes my plan for selling them all on eBay,\"Clary muttered.\"Selling them on what?\"Clary smiled blandly at him. \"A mythical place of great magical power.","2085":"The Christian does not think God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us.","2087":"All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.","2088":"If you carefully consider what you want to be said of you in the funeral experience, you will find your definition of success.","2089":"Hope lies in having more faith in the power of God to heal us than in the power of anything to hurt or destroy us. In realizing that as children of God we are bigger than our problems, we have the power at last to confront them.","2091":"There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathise with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life.

But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.","2137":"Over the years, I had nurtured the hope to be able to fly; to handle a machine as it rose higher and higher in the stratosphere was my dearest dream.","2140":"When art dresses in worn-out material it is most easily recognized as art.","2143":"There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.","2147":"We all learn lessons in life. Some stick, some don't. I have always learned more from rejection and failure than from acceptance and success.","2148":"Man's only true happiness is to live in hope of something to be won by him.

It's one of the reasons for their wickedness.","2255":"I love sleep. My life has the tendency to fall apart when I'm awake, you know?","2259":"Dying is an art, like everything else.

I guess you could say I've a call.","2263":"There are three ingredients in the good life: learning, earning and yearning.","2264":"One mustn't ask apple trees for oranges, France for sun, women for love, life for happiness.","2266":"A secondhand wardrobe hand clothes doesn't make one an artist. Neither do a hair-trigger temper, melancholic nature, propensity for tears, hating your parents, or HIV. I hate to say it - none of these make one an artist. They can help, but just as being gay doesn't make one witty... the only thing that makes one an artist is making art.","2267":"Death's got an Invisibility Cloak?\"Harry interrupted again.\"So he can sneak up on people,\"said Ron. \"Sometimes he gets bored of running at them, flapping his arms and shrieking...","2269":"I like the night.

Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope?","2429":"There is no love that is not an echo.","2430":"For art to exist, for any sort of aesthetic activity to exist, a certain physiological precondition is indispensable: intoxication.","2431":"I've never fooled anyone. I've let people fool themselves. They didn't bother to find out who and what I was. Instead they would invent a character for me. I wouldn't argue with them. They were obviously loving somebody I wasn't.","2434":"There is no medicine like hope, no incentive so great, and no tonic so powerful as expectation of something tomorrow.","2436":"I remember my mother's prayers and they have always followed me.

Hank, when people call people nerds, mostly what they\u2019re saying is \u2018you like stuff.\u2019 Which is just not a good insult at all.

Life's a bitch. You've got to go out and kick ass.","3565":"Stupid people are dangerous.","3566":"Everything in the world is about sex except sex. Sex is about power.","3567":"If we listened to our intellect, we'd never have a love affair. We'd never have a friendship. We'd never go into business, because we'd be cynical. Well, that's nonsense. You've got to jump off cliffs all the time and build your wings on the way down.","3568":"I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird'... I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement.","3574":"I have a theory that selflessness and bravery aren't all that different.","3575":"I am very interested and fascinated how everyone loves each other, but no one really likes each other.","3576":"Peter would probably throw a party if I stopped breathing.''Well,' he says, 'I would only go if there was cake.","3580":"Russian humor is to adapt or make some sense or nonsense out of the insanity of their lives.","3584":"Love is so short, forgetting is so long.","3585":"I don't want to lose the boy with the bread.","3586":"I wonder how many people I've looked at all my life and never seen.","3593":"With an apple I will astonish Paris.","3594":"Why should it be essential to love rarely in order to love much?","3595":"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.","3596":"Never allow someone to be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option.","3603":"Every production of an artist should be the expression of an adventure of his soul.","3605":"Percy wouldn't notice a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing one of Dobby's hats.","3606":"Man is least himself when he talks in his own person.

Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.","3619":"Come, gentlemen, I hope we shall drink down all unkindness.","3621":"It's a wonderful world. You can't go backwards. You're always moving forward. It's the wonderful part about life. And that's terrific.","3624":"The important thing is to not stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.\u2014\"Old Man's Advice to Youth: 'Never Lose a Holy Curiosity.'\"LIFE Magazine (2 May 1955) p. 64","3625":"I am a badass, and I recognize that you, too, are a badass.","3629":"A youth, when at home, should be filial and, abroad, respectful to his elders.

I'm okay once I realize you're here.","3683":"The difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.","3684":"Nothing of me is original. I am the combined effort of everyone I've ever known.","3695":"Books are my friends, my companions.

I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends.","3710":"Neither should a ship rely on one small anchor, nor should life rest on a single hope.","3712":"That it will never come again is what makes life sweet.","3716":"What I need is the dandelion in the spring. The bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction. The promise that life can go on, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again.","3718":"I am not sure exactly what heaven will be like, but I know that when we die and it comes time for God to judge us, he will not ask, 'How many good things have you done in your life?' rather he will ask, 'How much love did you put into what you did?","3726":"This is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love: the more they give, the more they possess.","3727":"Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.","3728":"Love is the attempt to form a friendship inspired by beauty.","3737":"It's a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing.","3738":"It's not denial.

I mean everybody. All of the people in the whole world, I mean everybody \u2014 no matter how dull and boring they are on the outside. Inside them they've all got unimaginable, magnificent, wonderful, stupid, amazing worlds... Not just one world. Hundreds of them. Thousands, maybe.","3820":"Who said nights were for sleep?","3821":"Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction.","3824":"While it is important for people to see your promise you must also remember that hope is the keeper of both happiness and disappointment, the father of both progress and failure.","3826":"Our truest life is when we are in dreams awake.","3830":"You are the answer to every prayer I've offered. You are a song, a dream, a whisper, and I don't know how I could have lived without you for as long as I have.","3831":"Prayer is not asking. It is a longing of the soul. It is daily admission of one's weakness. It is better in prayer to have a heart without words than words without a heart.","3834":"There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense.","3835":"It may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime...","3837":"For some reason, we can't just enjoy somebody else's success.

This is a fault. Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only Beauty. There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.","3849":"Uncertainty is the refuge of hope.","3851":"There is only one difference between a long life and a good dinner: that, in the dinner, the sweets come last.","3854":"Sometimes crying or laughing are the only options left, and laughing feels better right now.","3855":"I can feel Peeta press his forehead into my temple and he asks, 'So now that you've got me, what are you going to do with me?' I turn into him. 'Put you somewhere you can't get hurt.","3857":"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.","3860":"You wouldn't worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do.","3864":"Nobody enjoys the 'little show about nothing' humor more than me, but that is never the way I look at it.","3865":"True life is lived when tiny changes occur.","3868":"It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it.","3871":"Finnick?\"I say, \"Maybe some pants?\"He looks down at his legs as if noticing his outfit for the first time. Then he whips off his hospital gown leaving him in just his underwear. \"Why? Do you find this\"-- he strikes a ridiculously provocative pose -- \"distracting?\"I laugh. Boggs looks embarrassed and Finnick looks more like the guy I met at the Quarter Quell","3872":"Depth of friendship does not depend on length of acquaintance.","3876":"The basic fact about human existence is not that it is a tragedy, but that it is a bore. It is not so much a war as an endless standing in line.","3879":"You haven't got a letter on yours,\"George observed. \"I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid-we know we're called Gred and Forge.","3880":"You must stay drunk on writing so reality cannot destroy you.","3882":"If music be the food of love, play on,Give me excess of it; that surfeiting,The appetite may sicken, and so die.","3883":"People haven't always been there for me but music always has.","3888":"Life is something to do when you can't get to sleep.","3891":"I like living. I have sometimes been wildly, despairingly, acutely miserable, racked with sorrow; but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing.","3892":"Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal.","3893":"Wrinkles should merely indicate where the smiles have been.","3894":"Love is a friendship set to music.","3898":"Why anybody gets my sense of humor I never know, but I do know that when they do, I keep them as close as I possibly can.","3899":"To me, if life boils down to one thing, it's movement. To live is to keep moving.","3900":"If a work of art is rich and vital and complete, those who have artistic instincts will see its beauty, and those to whom ethics appeal more strongly than aesthetics will see its moral lesson. It will fill the cowardly with terror, and the unclean will see in it their own shame.","3901":"If any person wish to be idle, let them fall in love.","3903":"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.","3904":"Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently.","3905":"Any fool can know. The point is to understand.","3908":"An empowered organisation is one in which individuals have the knowledge, skill, desire, and opportunity to personally succeed in a way that leads to collective organisational success.","3909":"My hope still is to leave the world a bit better than when I got here.","3913":"Bob Dole used to be really funny. Barney Frank can be kind of funny. Bob Kerrey has a good sense of humor.","3916":"Each and every master, regardless of the era or the place, heard the call and attained harmony with heaven and earth. There are many paths leading to the top of Mount Fuji, but there is only one summit - love.","3921":"I have tried to keep on with my striving because this is the only hope I have of ever achieving anything worthwhile and lasting.","3923":"Life would be infinitely happier if we could only be born at the age of eighty and gradually approach eighteen.","3926":"Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.","3927":"Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn't.","3931":"One's life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others, by means of love, friendship, indignation and compassion.","3932":"The ladder of success is never crowded at the top.","3933":"I hope to stand firm enough to not go backward, and yet not go forward fast enough to wreck the country's cause.","3938":"One of the Silent Brothers is here to see you. Hodge sent me to wake you up. Actually he offered to wake you himself, but since it's 5 a.m., I figured you'd be less cranky if you had something nice to look at.\"\"Meaning you?\"\"What else?","3939":"She is too fond of books, and it has turned her brain.","3940":"It's just that I don't want to be somebody's crush. If somebody likes me, I want them to like the real me, not what they think I am. And I don't want them to carry it around inside. I want them to show me, so I can feel it too.","3941":"Fan the sinking flame of hilarity with the wing of friendship; and pass the rosy wine.","3942":"An excuse becomes an obstacle in your journey to success when it is made in place of your best effort or when it is used as the object of the blame.","3945":"Find ecstasy in life; the mere sense of living is joy enough.","3947":"I'm a bit of a clothes hoarder, admittedly. I try to weed out stuff. My girlfriends come over for cheese and wine and go shopping in my wardrobe.

When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and the most logical thing to do is to quit. That's exactly what the majority of men do.","3954":"Be careful to leave your sons well instructed rather than rich, for the hopes of the instructed are better than the wealth of the ignorant.","3956":"The courage of life is often a less dramatic spectacle than the courage of a final moment; but it is no less a magnificent mixture of triumph and tragedy.","3959":"I may die young, but at least I'll die smart.","3962":"Time is the most precious element of human existence. The successful person knows how to put energy into time and how to draw success from time.","3964":"Isn't it the moment of most profound doubt that gives birth to new certainties? Perhaps hopelessness is the very soil that nourishes human hope; perhaps one could never find sense in life without first experiencing its absurdity.","3969":"I am coming to terms with the fact that loving someone requires a leap of faith, and that a soft landing is never guaranteed.","3970":"I never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read in the train.","3971":"Hell is empty and all the devils are here.","3972":"Painting is poetry that is seen rather than felt, and poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen.","3982":"I don't want to die without any scars.","3983":"Bran thought about it. 'Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?''That is the only time a man can be brave,' his father told him.","3984":"Sometimes you make choices in life and sometimes choices make you.","3985":"I believe in luck: how else can you explain the success of those you dislike?","3987":"Just as despair can come to one only from other human beings, hope, too, can be given to one only by other human beings.","3992":"Will looked horrified. \"What kind of monster could possibly hate chocolate?","3993":"Love doesn't just sit there, like a stone, it has to be made, like bread; remade all the time, made new.","3994":"You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist.","3995":"For you, a thousand times over","3999":"I don't know what can be so dangerous about giving people hope.","4000":"The difference between me as Brian Warner or Marilyn Manson is just words. Same personality, sensibility, sense of humor, behavior. He is me.","4001":"Once you say you're going to settle for second, that's what happens to you in life.","4003":"It is impossible to love and to be wise.","4004":"She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it).","4005":"But I don\u2019t want to go among mad people,\"Alice remarked.\"Oh, you can\u2019t help that,\"said the Cat: \"we\u2019re all mad here.

And if we burn, you burn with us!","4007":"Some things don't last forever, but some things do. Like a good song, or a good book, or a good memory you can take out and unfold in your darkest times, pressing down on the corners and peering in close, hoping you still recognize the person you see there.","4009":"When I turned about 14, I developed a friendship with this guy whose mom was the secretary to Ernest Angley, the faith healer, who's very popular in the Midwest. He had a television show, and he was sort of like Liberace mixed with Jerry Falwell - very glitzy, very high-tech.","4013":"Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future.","4016":"Nobody can hurt me without my permission.","4017":"Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. It's not something you learn in school. But if you haven't learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven't learned anything.","4018":"Can I help you with something?\"Clary turned instant traitor against her gender. \"Those girls on the other side of the car are staring at you.\"Jace assumed an air of mellow gratification. \"Of course they are,\"he said, \"I am stunningly attractive.","4019":"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.","4020":"And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.","4028":"The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life.","4032":"I\u2019d said it before and meant it: Alive or undead, the love of my life was a badass.","4033":"You have to die a few times before you can reallylive.","4034":"Mom says it's because she has PMS.Do you even know what that means?\"I'm not a little kid anymore.

They must be felt with the heart","4039":"You cannot have a positive life and a negative mind.","4042":"If you like her, if she makes you happy, and if you feel like you know her---then don't let her go.","4045":"In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free - honorable alike in that we give and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth.","4050":"Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.","4051":"Life's under no obligation to give us what we expect.","4053":"I've got a stele we can use. Who wants to do me?\"\"A regrettable choice of words,\"muttered Magnus.","4054":"Music is a total constant. That's why we have such a strong visceral connection to it, you know? Because a song can take you back instantly to a moment, or a place, or even a person. No matter what else has changed in your or the world, that one song says the same, just like that moment.","4055":"Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.","4058":"There are men so philosophical that they can see humor in their own toothaches. But there has never lived a man so philosophical that he could see the toothache in his own humor.","4059":"No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.","4060":"Rhetoric may be defined as the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion. This is not a function of any other art.","4062":"Books are like mirrors: if a fool looks in, you cannot expect a genius to look out.","4063":"The wound is the place where the Light enters you.","4064":"You smell good, too,\u201d said PatchIt\u2019s called a shower.\u201d I was staring straight ahead. When he didn\u2019t answer, I turned sideways. \u201cSoap. Shampoo. Hot water.\u201dNaked. I know the drill.","4066":"To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best day and night to make you like everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight and never stop fighting.","4067":"You are a product of your environment. So choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective. Analyze your life in terms of its environment. Are the things around you helping you toward success - or are they holding you back?","4074":"The simple things are also the most extraordinary things, and only the wise can see them.","4075":"One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.","4076":"Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.","4077":"Success is neither magical nor mysterious. Success is the natural consequence of consistently applying the basic fundamentals.","4083":"No better way is there to learn to love Nature than to understand Art. It dignifies every flower of the field. And, the boy who sees the thing of beauty which a bird on the wing becomes when transferred to wood or canvas will probably not throw the customary stone.","4085":"The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the surface of a gas covered planet going around a nuclear fireball 90 million miles away and think this to be normal is obviously some indication of how skewed our perspective tends to be.","4087":"That is part of the beauty of all literature. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you're not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong.","4088":"Resist much, obey little.","4089":"The road to hell is paved with adverbs.","4094":"Music is a moral law. It gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything.","4095":"The art of being happy lies in the power of extracting happiness from common things.","4096":"The truth is that love smashes into your life like an ice floe, and even if your heart is built like the Titanic you go down.","4097":"Sometimes our light goes out, but is blown again into instant flame by an encounter with another human being.","4099":"I don't trust people who don't love themselves and tell me, 'I love you.' ...

The impossible just takes longer.","4104":"Anybody who succeeds is helping people. The secret to success is find a need and fill it; find a hurt and heal it; find a problem and solve it.","4112":"You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts...but you cannot deny he's got style...","4113":"Don't talk to me.\"\"Why not?\"\"Because I want to fix that in my memory for ever. Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret...","4114":"No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally \u2013 and often far more \u2013 worth reading at the age of fifty and beyond.","4115":"It always shocked me when I realized that I wasn\u2019t the only person in the world who thought and felt such strange and awful things.","4116":"Ever had a flying burrito hit you? Well, it's a deadly projectile, right up there with cannonballs and grenades.","4117":"The compensation of a very early success is a conviction that life is a romantic matter. In the best sense one stays young.","4121":"I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed.

It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.","7287":"I'm going to keep going until I succeed \u2014 or die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for years.","7288":"In a lot of ways, success is much harder than I thought it would be. I figured that you'd get here and then everything would be happily ever after. But, it's hard work, almost harder once you're successful because you've got to maintain it.","7289":"Before the flowers of friendship faded friendship faded.","7297":"Now that she had nothing to lose, she was free.","7299":"Whenever you think or you believe or you know, you're a lot of other people: but the moment you feel, you're nobody-but-yourself.","7300":"It is good to have an end to journey toward; but it is the journey that matters, in the end.","7304":"It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.","7310":"Ask for what you want and be prepared to get it!","7311":"If you love something set it free, but don't be surprised if it comes back with herpes.","7313":"The power of a glance has been so much abused in love stories, that it has come to be disbelieved in. Few people dare now to say that two beings have fallen in love because they have looked at each other. Yet it is in this way that love begins, and in this way only.","7314":"Can you understand? Someone, somewhere, can you understand me a little, love me a little? For all my despair, for all my ideals, for all that - I love life. But it is hard, and I have so much - so very much to learn.","7318":"To deprive a man of his natural liberty and to deny to him the ordinary amenities of life is worse then starving the body; it is starvation of the soul, the dweller in the body.","7323":"I will take the sun in my mouthand leap into the ripe air Alive with closed eyesto dash against darkness","7325":"I sought to hear the voice of God and climbed the topmost steeple, but God declared: \"Go down again - I dwell among the people.","7328":"Books are easily destroyed.

JUST THINK OF IT AS LEAVING EARLY TO AVOID THE RUSH.","7356":"You know, some people think Shadowhunters are just myths. Like mummies and genies.\"Kyle grinned at Jace. \"Can you grant wishes?\"\"That depends,\"he said. \"Do you wish to be punched in the face?","7357":"It's so strange how life works: You want something and you wait and wait and feel like it's taking forever to come. Then it happens and it's over and all you want to do is curl back up in that moment before things changed.","7358":"Well-read people are less likely to be evil.","7360":"That was enterprising,\"Will sounded nearly impressed.Nate smiled. Tess shot him a furious look. \"Don't look pleased with yourself. When Will says 'enterprising' he means 'morally deficient.'\"\"No, I mean enterprising,\"said Will. \"When I mean morally deficient, I say, 'Now, that's something I would have done'.","7361":"There's no need to clarify my finger snap,\"said Magnus. \"The implication was clear in the snap itself.","7362":"If you want to get laid, go to college. If you want an education, go to the library.","7363":"Be steady and well-ordered in your life so that you can be fierce and original in your work.","7365":"I want to grow a flower for every time someone tells me \u201cF*** you.\u201d Then I\u2019ll go back to that person and pin the flower on their lapel in a gesture of friendship. And while they are looking down on it in astonishment, I\u2019ll bunch up my knuckles and punch them in the face.","7367":"Freeing yourself was one thing, claiming ownership of that freed self was another.","7368":"Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.","7370":"Another belief of mine: that everyone else my age is an adult, whereas I am merely in disguise.","7371":"People have forgotten this truth,\"the fox said. \"But you mustn\u2019t forget it. You become responsible forever for what you\u2019ve tamed. You\u2019re responsible for your rose.","7372":"Anybody can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a very fine nature to sympathise with a friend's success.","7374":"Think of success as a game of chance in which you have control over the odds. As you begin to master concepts in personal achievement, you are increasing your odds of achieving success.","7378":"Fiction is like a spider's web, attached ever so slightly perhaps, but still attached to life at all four corners. Often the attachment is scarcely perceptible.","7379":"Doubt thou the stars are fire, Doubt that the sun doth move. Doubt truth to be a liar, But never doubt I love.","7381":"Art is a step from what is obvious and well-known toward what is arcane and concealed.","7383":"But I didn't understand then. That I could hurt somebody so badly she would never recover. That a person can, just by living, damage another human being beyond repair.","7386":"Man often becomes what he believes himself to be. If I keep on saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is possible that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, if I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning.","7387":"Be awesome! Be a book nut!","7388":"Even strength must bow to wisdom sometimes.","7390":"Cry. Forgive. Learn. Move on. Let your tears water the seeds of your future happiness.","7401":"Being Irish, I always had this love of words.","7404":"I am both happy and sad at the same time, and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.","7405":"Usually we walk around constantly believing ourselves. \"I'm okay\"we say. \"I'm alright\". But sometimes the truth arrives on you and you can't get it off. That's when you realize that sometimes it isn't even an answer--it's a question. Even now, I wonder how much of my life is convinced.","7406":"if you love two people at the same time, choose the second. Because if you really loved the first one, you wouldn't have fallen for the second.","7409":"When I do good, I feel good. When I do bad, I feel bad. That's my religion.","7412":"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one...just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.","7413":"If we listened to our intellect we'd never have a love affair. We'd never have a friendship. We'd never go in business because we'd be cynical: \"It's gonna go wrong.\"Or \"She's going to hurt me.\"Or,\"I've had a couple of bad love affairs, so therefore . . .\"Well, that's nonsense. You're going to miss life. You've got to jump off the cliff all the time and build your wings on the way down.","7414":"Life doesn't imitate art, it imitates bad television.","7419":"You can\u2019t tell mewhat to do anymore, Travis! I don\u2019t belong to you!\u201dIn the second it took him to turn and face me, hisexpression had contorted into anger. He stomped towardme, planting his hands on the bed and leaning into my face.\u201cWELL I BELONG TO YOU!\u201d The veins in his neckbulged as he shouted, and I met his glare, refusing to evenflinch.

Life's not always fair, but I believe if you keep doing the right thing, God will get you to where you are.","7431":"Every couple needs to argue now and then. Just to prove that the relationship is strong enough to survive. Long-term relationships, the ones that matter, are all about weathering the peaks and the valleys.","7432":"If you ever meet the man who could take advantage of Isabelle, you\u2019ll have to let me know. I\u2019d like to shake his hand. Or run away from him very fast, I\u2019m not sure which.","7434":"Book collecting is an obsession, an occupation, a disease, an addiction, a fascination, an absurdity, a fate. It is not a hobby. Those who do it must do it. Those who do not do it, think of it as a cousin of stamp collecting, a sister of the trophy cabinet, bastard of a sound bank account and a weak mind.","7435":"Men go to far greater lengths to avoid what they fear than to obtain what they desire.","7438":"The truth will set you free. But not until it is finished with you.","7440":"Kind people have a way of working their way inside me and rooting there.","7441":"God alert!\"Blackjack yelled. \"It's the wine dude!Mr. D sighed in exasperation. \"The next person, or horse, who calls me the 'wine dude' will end up in a bottle of Merlot!","7442":"It's the job that's never started as takes longest to finish.","7443":"The easy confidence with which I know another man's religion is folly teaches me to suspect that my own is also.","7446":"In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule.","7447":"If my doctor told me I had only six minutes to live, I wouldn't brood. I'd type a little faster.","7450":"I didn\u2019t go to religion to make me happy. I always knew a bottle of Port would do that. If you want a religion to make you feel really comfortable, I certainly don\u2019t recommend Christianity.","7452":"Curiouser and curiouser!","7461":"My painting does not come from the easel.","7463":"It's hard to enjoy practical jokes when your whole life feels like one.","7467":"The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.","7468":"If you have enough book space, I don't want to talk to you.","7472":"We can't be afraid of change. You may feel very secure in the pond that you are in, but if you never venture out of it, you will never know that there is such a thing as an ocean, a sea.

Trust your instincts. And never hope more than you work.","7490":"Time extracts various values from a painter's work. When these values are exhausted the pictures are forgotten, and the more a picture has to give, the greater it is.","7491":"The bond forged between us was not one that could be broken by absence, distance, or time. And no matter how much more special or beautiful or brilliant or perfect than me he might be, he was as irreversibly altered as I was. As I would always belong to him, so would he always be mine.","7493":"A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.","7494":"The most certain sign of wisdom is cheerfulness.","7496":"If everyone demanded peace instead of another television set, then there'd be peace.","7499":"I found myself thinking about President William McKinley, the third American president to be assassinated. He lived for several days after he was shot, and towards the end, his wife started crying and screaming, \"I want to go too!

It may simply be that he has a small piece of fluff in his ear.","7505":"It is always sad when someone leaves home, unless they are simply going around the corner and will return in a few minutes with ice-cream sandwiches.","7507":"I forgot that's what gets you all hot and bothered, Jace, girls killing things.\"\"I like anyone killing things, especially me.\"he said with a smile.","7508":"I\u2019m glad we had the times together just to laugh and sing a song, seems like we just got started and then before you know it, the times we had together were gone.","7509":"Just as you wouldn't leave the house without taking a shower, you shouldn't start the day without at least 10 minutes of sacred practice: prayer, meditation, inspirational reading.","7515":"Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart.","7519":"The difference between sex and love is that sex relieves tension and love causes it.","7520":"In the end that was the choice you made, and it doesn't matter how hard it was to make it. It matters that you did.","7521":"I want everyone to meet you. You're my favorite person of all time.","7522":"The starting point of all achievement is DESIRE. Keep this constantly in mind. Weak desire brings weak results, just as a small fire makes a small amount of heat.","7523":"Yes, and I\u2019m sure the arena will be full of bags of flour for me to chuck at people.","7526":"She was a genius of sadness, immersing herself in it, separating its numerous strands, appreciating its subtle nuances. She was a prism through which sadness could be divided into its infinite spectrum.","7527":"A short story is a different thing all together - a short story is like a kiss in the dark from a stranger.","7530":"If no one cares for you at all, do you even really exist?","7531":"Whenever people agree with me I always feel I must be wrong.","7534":"Friendship is like money, easier made than kept.","7537":"The secret of a happy marriage is finding the right person. You know they're right if you love to be with them all the time.","7540":"This is me, Ana. All of me...and I'm all yours. What do I have to do to make you realize that? To make you see that I want you any way I can get you. That I love you.","7541":"I am a part of all that I have met.","7542":"It takes a lot of time to be a genius. You have to sit around so much, doing nothing, really doing nothing.","7543":"And I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, 'If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.","7545":"Sometimes when I'm alone, I take the pearl from where it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy with the bread, the strong arms that warded off nightmares on the train, the kisses in the arena.","7547":"If you are a student you should always get a good nights sleep unless you have come to the good part of your book, and then you should stay up all night and let your schoolwork fall by the wayside, a phrase which means 'flunk'.","7548":"I like it when somebody gets excited about something.

It is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing.","7685":"If the moon smiled, she would resemble you.You leave the same impression Of something beautiful, but annihilating.","7686":"Whatever you do, you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs.
