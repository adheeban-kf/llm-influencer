Once you're done setting up the `config.ini` file, head to the `config.yaml` file and tweak the configs if needed. The below is the list of configurables and their functionalities.

| configurable | description | allowed values |
| :---:   | :---: | :---: |
| SCHEDULE_TIME | The time at which you want to post to your social media handle |  `00:01` to `23:59` |
