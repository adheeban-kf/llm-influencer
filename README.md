## What is llm-influencer ‚ùì

LLM Influencer is an AI-powered Twitter influencer that generates and posts daily quotes along with captivating images. It utilizes the powerful combination of ChatGPT and DALL-E 2, two state-of-the-art models developed by OpenAI. This repository contains the code for running and maintaining the bot.

## How llm-influencer works ‚öôÔ∏è

LLM Influencer harnesses the creative power of GPT-3, a cutting-edge generative AI model, to generate all the quotes posted on Twitter. These quotes draw inspiration from the curated corpus stored in the [finalq.json](https://github.com/iamadhee/llm-influencer/blob/main/data/finalq.json) file. To enhance the visual appeal of the posts, LLM Influencer pairs each quote with stunning images crafted by the DALL-E 2 image generation model.

  <summary><h2>Installation and Setup üî® </h2></summary>
  
  ### Installation
  clone this repository and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  
  
  ### Setup
  create a file named `config.ini` within the `influence/` directory and copy the below fields and fill in with your own credentials. No need to use quotes.
  ```ini
  [twitter]
  bearer_token=
  consumer_key=
  consumer_secret=
  access_token=
  access_token_secret=

  [openai]
  api_key=
  ```
  
  If you have trouble finding you credentials head to the below links for help:
- [twitter-api](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/api-key-and-secret)
- [openai-api](https://www.howtogeek.com/885918/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/)
  
  Once you've setup the config, you're good to go. To run the bot you just have to run `python3 influence`. This will create a quote, an image and posts it to the twitter account that you've provided. I've set this up as a cron job and you could too.
